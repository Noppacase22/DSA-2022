 This repository contains files for almost all weekly assignments given during the course.
 
 ## Practical Assignment
 The given task was to implement open hashing, which is done in hash_1.py
 This functionality is imported into later files and thus hash_1.py is required to run them succesfully.
 
 Part 3 (hash_3_x.py) is pressure test used to compare the speed and functionality of the implemented hash table versus array list.
 The task for ArrayList was to use nested loops. However I don't see a functional reason for this in this assignment, outside of purely demonstrative purposes. I have written of my reasoning in the documentation pdf shortly. In hindsight I should've written more extensively about the reasons why I didn't use nested loops, what would've happened if I had, and the implications of both. At least I only lost 1 point to it.
